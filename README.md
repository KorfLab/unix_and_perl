Unix and Perl Primer for Biologists
===================================

This course was developed for use at UC Davis in the Mac computer labs running from student USB flash drives. It can be used in other settings with minor modifications.

Perl has fallen out of favor among biologists. Most people are now using Python. If you're a new programmer, you should probably learn Python. However, if you need to maintain some older Perl-based code, this course may be useful to you.

If you want all of the course materials, including the data, download the zip file. Otherwise, we recommend HTML or PDF (unless you like reading Markdown).

This repos also has a Command-line Linux Bootcamp by Keith Bradnam (former member of the lab).
